## Project Related Info:

Please read the following information related to the project.

* I am using port 8082 for default profile and port 8083 for prod profile.
* Currently, the active profile is set to prod.
* For prod profile, I have exposed the following endpoints for the actuator.
    ```http://localhost:8083/swagger-ui.html
      http://localhost:8083/api-docs
      http://localhost:8083/api-docs
      http://localhost:8083/actuator/health
      http://localhost:8083/actuator/prometheus
    ```
* Result limits are preconfigured to 5. It can be changed by updating the property apiCalls.maxResult

## Technologies/Mechanisms used:
* Java 8 for development.
* Springboot 2.7 for auto configuration and embedded server.
* Maven for build.
* OpenApi for Self Documentation.
* FeignClient for calling third party services.
* Resilience4j circuit breaker pattern, bulkhead pattern for resilience.
* Micrometer, prometheus for exposing metrics on response times for upstream services.
* Docker for containerization.

## Improvement Suggestions:
Following improvements could have been made which I wasnâ€™t able to do due to time limitations.
* Better exception handling using controller advice with appropriate response codes.
*  Better visualization of metrics for response times by enabling a prometheus server on docker and using some metrics visualizing tool like Grafana.
*  Using Asyncrounous operations to introduce multithreading for concurrent requests.
*  Unit tests to make repeated calls to third party services to check concurrent requests handling.
